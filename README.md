# resume

This is a web application developed to showcase my resume as an application, this also icludes as one of the projects i have undertook in django.
This application is currently using AWS EC2 web service provider for deployment.

This application was built by using a static template downloaded from internet and converted to dynamic website by connecting to backend, developed using python-django 
web framework. Intention is to showcase backend development skills not the frnt-end.
